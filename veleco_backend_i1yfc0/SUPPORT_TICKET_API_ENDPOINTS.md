```typescript
// In your main server file (index.ts or app.ts)
import express from 'express';
import supportTicketRoutes from './support_ticket_routes';

const app = express();

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Mount support ticket routes
app.use('/api/support', supportTicketRoutes);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running with Support Ticket API');
});
```

### 2. Environment Variables

## üìä Data Models

### Ticket Categories
- `TECHNICAL_ISSUE` - Website bugs, app crashes
- `BILLING` - Billing inquiries, invoice issues
- `ACCOUNT` - Account access, password reset
- `PRODUCT` - Product defects, quality issues
- `ORDER` - Order status, delivery issues
- `PAYMENT` - Payment failures, refunds
- `GENERAL` - General inquiries
- `FEATURE_REQUEST` - New feature suggestions
- `BUG_REPORT` - Software bugs

### Priority Levels
- `LOW` - Non-urgent (response within regular business hours)
- `MEDIUM` - Standard priority (24-48 hours)
- `HIGH` - Important issues (12-24 hours)
- `URGENT` - Critical issues (4-8 hours)
- `CRITICAL` - System-breaking (1-2 hours)

### Status Types
- `OPEN` - New ticket, awaiting initial response
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Being actively worked on
- `WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE` - Awaiting customer response
- `RESOLVED` - Issue resolved, awaiting confirmation
- `CLOSED` - Completed and closed
- `REOPENED` - Previously resolved ticket reopened

## üß™ Testing

### Run the Test Suite

```bash
# Start your server
npm start

# In another terminal, run the API tests
bun run support_ticket_api_tests.ts
```

### Manual Testing with curl

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/support/health

# API information
curl http://localhost:3000/api/support/

# Create test ticket
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/support/tickets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @test_ticket_data.json
```

## üìß Email Notifications

The system automatically sends email notifications for:

1. **Ticket Creation** - Confirmation to customer + alert to support team
2. **New Responses** - Customer notified when support responds
3. **Status Changes** - Customer notified when ticket status updates
4. **Resolution** - Customer notified when ticket is resolved

All emails are logged in the database and can be retrieved via the email logs endpoint.

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **Authentication** - Add authentication middleware before mounting routes
2. **Authorization** - Implement role-based access control
3. **Rate Limiting** - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **Input Validation** - All inputs are validated with Zod schemas
5. **SQL Injection** - Protected by Prisma ORM

### Example Authentication Middleware

```typescript
import { Router } from 'express';
import supportTicketRoutes from './support_ticket_routes';

const router = Router();

// Authentication middleware
const authenticateUser = (req: any, res: any, next: any) => {
  // Your authentication logic here
  const token = req.headers.authorization;
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });
  }
  // Verify token and add user to req.user
  next();
};

// Public routes (no auth required)
router.post('/tickets', supportTicketRoutes); // Ticket creation
router.get('/health', supportTicketRoutes); // Health check

// Protected routes (auth required)
router.use(authenticateUser);
router.use('/admin', supportTicketRoutes); // All other routes
```

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Response Time** - Average time to first response
2. **Resolution Time** - Average time to resolve tickets
3. **Customer Satisfaction** - Follow-up surveys
4. **Agent Performance** - Tickets handled per agent
5. **Category Trends** - Most common issue types
6. **Email Delivery** - Success/failure rates

### Dashboard Queries

```sql
-- Average response time by category
SELECT category, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (last_response_at - created_at))/3600) as avg_hours
FROM support_ticket 
WHERE last_response_at IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY category;

-- Tickets by priority and status
SELECT priority, status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM support_ticket 
GROUP BY priority, status 
ORDER BY priority DESC, status;

-- Email delivery success rate
SELECT 
  email_type,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'sent' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as sent,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'sent' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM ticket_email_log 
GROUP BY email_type;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Add Custom Fields

To add custom fields to tickets, update the Prisma schema:

```prisma
model support_ticket {
  // ... existing fields
  
  // Custom fields
  order_number      String?
  product_id        Int?
  urgency_level     String?
  customer_tier     String?
  source_channel    String? // web, mobile, phone, email
}
```

### Custom Email Templates

Modify templates in `support_ticket_mail.ts`:

```typescript
const EMAIL_TEMPLATES = {
  // Add your custom templates
  orderIssue: {
    subject: (orderNumber: string) => `Order Issue: ${orderNumber}`,
    customerBody: (data: any) => `
      <!-- Your custom HTML email template -->
    `
  }
};
```

## üö® Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling:

- **400 Bad Request** - Invalid input data
- **401 Unauthorized** - Authentication required
- **403 Forbidden** - Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found** - Ticket not found
- **409 Conflict** - Unique constraint violation
- **500 Internal Server Error** - Server errors

All errors are logged and include helpful error messages.
