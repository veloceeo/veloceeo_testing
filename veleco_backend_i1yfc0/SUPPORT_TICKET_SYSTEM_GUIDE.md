```

### Frontend Integration

The API provides RESTful endpoints that can be consumed by any frontend framework. Example usage:

```javascript
// Create a new ticket
const response = await fetch('/api/support/tickets', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    subject: 'Payment Issue',
    description: 'Unable to process payment',
    category: 'PAYMENT',
    priority: 'HIGH',
    contact_email: 'customer@example.com',
    contact_name: 'John Doe'
  })
});

// Get tickets with filtering
const tickets = await fetch('/api/support/tickets?status=OPEN&category=PAYMENT&page=1&limit=10');
```
